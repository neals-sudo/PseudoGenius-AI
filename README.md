# PseudoGenius AI ðŸš€

Hey there! Welcome to **PseudoGenius AI**: Your new best friend for coding your own pseudocode language and converting it into runnable code in whatever language you need without worrying about syntax!

## How it works

Design your pseudocode in any style you like, using the versatile YAML syntax. This solution effortlessly transforms it into code for your chosen programming language, eliminating the need to memorize syntax details.

## Getting Started

First things first, let's get you set up. You're going to need Python and some magic spells (aka libraries) to get rolling.

### Installation

After you clone the project, cd to the project's directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting Up Your OpenAI Key
Before you start turning pseudocode into real code, you need to enter your OpenAI API key to PseudoGenius AI. 

1. In your project directory, create a file named .env.
2. Open .env and add the following line:
```makefile

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```
3. Replace your_openai_api_key_here with your actual OpenAI API key.


### Usage

Create your pseudocode code inside of pseudo.yaml file, and then run:

```bash

python main.py <language>
```

Replace <language> with the programming language that you want. Hit enter, and watch the magic happen!
