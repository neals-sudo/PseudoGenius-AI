# PseudoGenius AI ðŸš€

Hey there! Welcome to **PseudoGenius AI** - your new best friend for creating your own language of pseudocode into legit, runnable code in whatever language you need without worrying about syntax!

The code is powered by ChatGPT-4 model. 

## Getting Started

First things first, let's get you set up. You're going to need Python and some magic spells (aka libraries) to get rolling.

### Installation

After you clone the project, cd to the project's directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting Up Your OpenAI Key
Before you start turning pseudocode into real code, you need to enter your OpenAI API key to PseudoGenius AI. 

1. In your project directory, create a file named .env.
2. Open .env and add the following line:
```makefile

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```
3. Replace your_openai_api_key_here with your actual OpenAI API key.


### Usage

Ready to turn pseudocode into real code? Here's how you do it:


Create your pseudocode file inside of pseudo.yaml file, and then run:

```bash

python main.py <language>
```

Replace <language> with the programming language that you want. Hit enter, and watch the magic happen!
